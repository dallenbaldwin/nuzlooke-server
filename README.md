# nuzlooke-server

welcome to the nuzlooke server repo! This is the server code for my capstone project at UVU Spring 2021

## Things to keep in mind

-  set up [localstack](https://dev.to/goodidea/how-to-fake-aws-locally-with-localstack-27me)
   -  check the logs if s3 doesn't go where you're expecting
-  run the server: `npm run serve`
-  enjoy
